## DSA Airflow code review

###  Contributors:

- [Dylan Peterson](https://github.com/DyPeterson)

###  Description

A [Data Stack Academy](https://www.datastack.academy/) code review project that makes a Apache Airflow DAG that a user can run through the Apache Airflow GUI. 

###  Technologies Used:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/)

- [Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/)

####  Programs used:

- [Visual Code Studio](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

- [Windows Terminal](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/windows-terminal/9N0DX20HK701?hl=en-us&gl=US) ( Running: [WSL2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) ([ubuntu 20.04](https://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/)))

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

###  Setup & Installation:

1. Through the terminal like [GitBash](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

	2. Open the terminal and navigate to where you would like the new project to be using `cd` commands. Its also recommended that you make a new directory using `mkdir *directory-name*`.

	3. Clone the repository using the command `git clone https://github.com/DyPeterson/apache_cr.git`

	4. After cloning the directory it will appear in the directory that your terminal is set to. So make sure you are in the directory that you want this project copied to.

	5. Once this project is cloned you can navigate to that folder within your terminal and create a virtual environment `python3.7 -m venv *any-name*`. Now activate the venv with `source *any-name*/bin/activate`

	6. Install requirements in venv `pip install -r requirements.txt`

	7. `code .` to open in default coding software.

2. Through GitHub.com

	3. Go to the project's directory page **[HERE](https://github.com/DyPeterson/bigquery_cr.git)**

	4. Click the green `code` button to open the drop-down menu.

	5. At the bottom of the menu will have *Download Zip*. Go ahead and click it to download the project.

	6. Once downloaded find the `.zip` file and right-click it to bring up the menu. Within that menu click `Extract Here` to extract it in the current folder or click `Extract Files...`to select which folder you would like the project in.

	7. Once the project has been extracted, locate the folder in a terminal and open it with `code .` .

#### Setting up Apach Airflow

1. Within the terminal, make sure you are located within the projects repo. 
2. Download docker-compose.yml within the terminal with `curl -LfO 'https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/docker-compose.yaml'`
3. Make directories for logs and plugins `mkdir ./logs ./plugins`
4. Set the user id as a variable in a .env file `echo -e "AIRFLOW_UID=$(id -u)\nAIRFLOW_GID=0" > .env`
5. Initialize Airflow `docker-compose up airflow-init`
6. Once finished running start the container with `docker-compose up`
7. Your Airflow is now running. You can access the GUI in your web browser at: http://localhost:8080/home. With the login being located in the docker-compose.yml here: ![displays docker-compose.yml section that has login details](img/airflow-login.png)
8. Once login in you can see a list of your DAGs. The one for this project is labled `ch6_code_review`, to find it easier you can also search with the tags `ch6` `dsa` `code_review`. Click its name to open up to the defaulted graph view.
9. To run this DAG click the â–º button in the upper right. 
10. After the DAG is run, you can check each individual task to see it's output.

###  Details
This Apache Airflow DAG uses BashOperator to `echo "Dylan" > /opt/airflow/dags/ch6_code_review.txt` which writes my name to a .txt file(echo_to_file). It then uses a PythonOperator to print the contents of the .txt file with a greeting(print_hello). After that it runs 3 simultaneous tasks that print a random value from a list of apples(apple_0, apple_1, apple_2). From there it's final task is an EmptyOperator which does nothing but demonstrate the end of the DAG(end_transmission)
